      <p>My name is Qiling Deng. I graduated from UC San Diego in 2014 with a bachelor of science degree in Joint Mathematics and Economics. 
        I have been working as a Regulatory Tax Analyst at H&R Block since 2017. 
        While I was working at H&R Block, I was involved in the development of their online tax return filing software products. 
        This gave me a valuable experience in software development and inspired me to learn web/software application programming. 
        Therefore, I have started a new journey in learning coding recently.</p>
        <p>Below are some of my projects, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions regarding my projects here.</p>
